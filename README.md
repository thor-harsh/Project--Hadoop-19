# Project--Hadoop-19


<table>

**In this Project we will be using Spark SQL to create a dataframe instead of RDD to count the number of friends associated with each age group.**

**Before diving into the project let's get to know about Spark**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark**?<br></br>
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on Single-Node Machines or Clusters.

**This dataset which we downloaded contains 4 columns:** <br></br>
 **(User-Id):** The id of the person <br></br>
 **(Name):** The name of the person<br></br>
 **(Type):** The three different weather recordings of a given place (TMAX,TMIN,PRCP) <br></br>
 **(Temperature):** The temperature of a given place <br></br>
 
 **Important Note: Go through the dataset before jumping to the code.**
